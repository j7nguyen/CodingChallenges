Coding Challenge Solutions
================

This repo contains my solutions to coding challenges on CodeEval, Coderbyte, and
other such sites.

Note that CodeEval solutions are meant to accept an input file of test cases.
Coderbyte solutions similarly use readline to accept inputs to test cases.

Problem descriptions are stated included as comments at the top of each file.
